# AutoVectors.jl
Julia vectors whose first and last indices are any integers

Most languages make a choice: arrays start at 0 or 1.  For some applications, one would
like arrays that start and end anywhere, e.g. the array runs from -3 to 10. AutoVectors
have this property. They also auto-resize based on writing outside their range.  The range is always
contigous. Reading outside the range gives 0.0 (or whatever the default element is). 

For example

julia> v = AutoVector(0.0)        # default element, determining type

AutoVector{Float64}(1, 0, 0, 0.0, Float64[])

julia> v[-3] = pi

Ï€ = 3.1415926535897...

julia> v[10] = exp(1.0)

2.718281828459045

julia> doprint(v)

-3 3.141592653589793

-2 0.0

-1 0.0

0 0.0

1 0.0

2 0.0

3 0.0

4 0.0

5 0.0

6 0.0

7 0.0

8 0.0

9 0.0

10 2.718281828459045

julia> arange(v)

-3:10

julia> v[15]      # No resizing, give default

0.0

julia> arange(v)

-3:10


AutoVectors have a variety of useful functions implemented, such as dot products and convolutions.
